## Project Overview

### **Objective**
- **Analyze** the correlation between Twitter sentiment and Teslaâ€™s stock movements.

## Workflow

### **1. Data Preparation**

#### **Data Collection**
- **Twitter Sentiment:** Scraped from Nitter using Selenium.  
- **Financial Data:** Extracted from Yahoo Finance.  

#### **Data Cleaning**
- Remove duplicate tweets to ensure uniqueness.  
- Filter out URLs, special characters, and irrelevant content.  
- Normalize text (e.g., lowercase conversion, punctuation removal) to optimize sentiment analysis.  

#### **Sentiment Analysis**
- **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner):** Computes sentiment scores ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).  
- **BERT-based Model:** Classifies sentiment into discrete categories (-1 for negative, +1 for positive).  
- **Additional Models:** Test alternative sentiment analysis approaches to enhance accuracy.
