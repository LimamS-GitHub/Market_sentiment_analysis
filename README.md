# Market_sentiment_analysis

This project aims to analyze market sentiment based on Twitter data and investigate its potential impact on stock performance.

My workflow includes:

- Data Collection: Scraping tweets using Selenium from Nitter and retrieving stock market data via Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
- Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, URLs, and special characters, and normalizing text to ensure high-quality data.
- Sentiment Analysis: Applying VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to score each tweet on a scale from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).
- Data Exploration: Examining sentiment distribution, identifying the most mentioned companies, and visualizing sentiment trends over time.
- Correlation with Market Data: Comparing sentiment scores with stock market indicators to detect any potential relationships between online discourse and actual market performance.
-Signal Generation: Transforming sentiment and financial indicators into potential buy/sell signals.

Feel free to explore the code, data, and visualizations in this repository to learn more about our approach and findings. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out.
